# **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard**  

This repository contains a dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to analyze road accident data effectively. This project was created during my training at **Anudip Foundation** and demonstrates advanced data visualization techniques.  

## **Dashboard Overview**  
The dashboard consists of **three interactive pages**, each providing unique insights:  

### **Page 1: General Overview**  
- Visualizations:  
  - Funnel Chart  
  - Treemap  
  - Horizontal Bar Graph  
  - Donut Chart  
- Interactive Element:  
  - Slicer for filtering data by years  

### **Page 2: Urban vs. Rural Analysis**  
- Visualizations:  
  - Pie Chart  
  - Scatter Plot  
- Interactive Element:  
  - Slicer for filtering data by Urban and Rural locations  

### **Page 3: Road Type and Speed Limit Analysis**  
- Visualizations:  
  - Advanced Line Area Graph  
- Interactive Element:  
  - Slicer for filtering data by Road Type  

## **Features**  
- Fully **dynamic dashboard** with interactive slicers and charts  
- Easy navigation across different aspects of road accident data  
- Insights into factors such as accident trends, urban-rural comparisons, and road-specific patterns  

## **How to Use**  
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.  
3. Explore the data by interacting with slicers and visualizations.
